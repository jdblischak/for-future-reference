[conda](https://docs.conda.io/) is a package and environment manager.

> Package, dependency and environment management for any languageâ€”Python, R,
Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++, FORTRAN, and more.

## Pin a package

```
conda config --add pinned_packages conda-forge::r-callr=3.3.0
```

To only pin the package in the current environment, use the `--env` flag:

> **--env**             Write to the active conda environment .condarc file.
                        If no environment is
                        active, write to the user config file.

```
conda config --env --add pinned_packages conda-forge::r-callr=3.3.0
```

Note that this isn't well-documented. The current conda docs recommend 
[pinning a package](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html#preventing-packages-from-updating-pinning)
by manually creatingthe file `pinned` in the `conda-meta` subdirectory of the
environment, and then adding the pins there.
