* View the most recent exit code with `$?`

```{bash}
echo "a b c" | grep b
echo $?
```

```{bash}
echo "a b c" | grep z
echo $?
```

* Use process substitution to save standard output to a temporary file. This is
very useful for when a command only accepts files or needs to accept multiple
files as input. See the very nice blog post [Using Names Pipes and Process
Substitution in Bioinformatics][process-substitution] for more details.

```{bash, error=TRUE}
diff <(echo -e "1\n2\n3") <(echo -e "a\nb\nc")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# A note on the above chunk. I had to set error=TRUE because if the last line of
# a bash chunk has a non-zero exit code, then knitr fails.

```

* Use `hash` to see a tally of the executables you have run and `hash -r` to
reset the hash. Bash first looks in the hash prior to searching `$PATH` (since
that is faster), so it is useful to reset the hash anytime you modify `$PATH`.

```{bash}

ls > /dev/null
R --version > /dev/null
